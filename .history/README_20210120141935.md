# SeedDeploy

## Summary

Are you mysteriously obsessed with gardening? Do you spend long periods of time looking at plants online? Do you ask for seeds for presents and then keep them in the fridge? Have you bought dirt more than once during your current lifetime?

This app may be what you are looking for.

## Problem

Individual items in a garden need to be planted at specific dates. As gardens become larger and larger, the planning becomes increasingly time consuming.

## Solution

SeedDeploy (a name I came up with in approximately the same amount of time it took me to write this sentence) is designed to simplify your garden planning.

User flow will go like thus:

1. Sign up
2. Add gardening zone OR manually add the last and first frost dates for your location
3. Choose garden type: vegetable or flower
4. Add seeds either manually or by searching our database
5. View either: Seed Collection OR automagically populated Seed Calendar

This user flow will be updated as the gardening expert tactfully highlights my blindspots to the cycles and processes fundamental to the foods and plants that I have been obliviously surrounded by for my entire life.
